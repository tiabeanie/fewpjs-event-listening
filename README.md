# Interacting with the DOM via JavaScript Event Listeners

## Learning Goals

- Demonstrate triggering event listeners on DOM nodes with `addEventListener()`

## Introduction

We know how to manipulate nodes in the DOM by using JavaScript. We also know
that events can be _handled_ and can do work inside _callback functions_ when
the event is triggered. JavaScript programmers often say we are "listening" for
an event in order to "execute" or "call" a _callback function_.

In order to teach nodes (or, "elements") to "listen" for an event, we use
`addEventListener()`. It allows us to associate "hearing" an event with
executing a callback.

## Demonstrate Defining Event Listeners on DOM Nodes with `addEventListener()`

`addEventListener()` takes two arguments:

1. the name of the event
2. a _callback function_ to "handle" the event

Take a look at `index.html` in the browser. When you click in the `<input>`
area, nothing happens. Now let's set up some _event handling_.

We'll start by adding an event listener for the `click` event on the
`input#input` element in `index.html`.

Try out the following in the Chrome DevTools console:

```js
const input = document.getElementById('input');
input.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  alert('I was clicked!');
});
```

When you click inside of `input#input`, **_now_**, you will get an alert box.

Take this code and paste it into the `index.js` file's `addingEventListener`
function.

Let's review the parts of this code:

1. The node that will be doing the listening. We store that node in the `input` constant
2. The invocation of `addEventListener` on the node that will be doing the listening
  1. The first argument is the event name to listen for
  2. The second argument is the _callback function_. It's work that will be executed
     when the node "hears" the event

## Conclusion

When you have pasted the solution into the `addingEventListener` function, your
tests should pass when you run `learn`. This means you can run `learn submit`
and move to the next lesson!

**Note:** You've added the `addEventListener()` function inside the
`addingEventListener()` function. If you want to test the code in the browser,
recall that you will need to call the outer function in `index.js`. Executing
`addingEventListener()` will activate the event listener. Be sure to refresh the
page first to load the new code in `index.js`.
